# 0x08 C# - Inheritance


**C# inheritance, type checking, override and new**


## Learning Objectives

* What is inheritance
* How is polymorphism achieved with inheritance
* What is a base class
* What is a derived class
* How to create a derived class
* How to override a method or property inherited from the base class
* What is the difference between the `override` and `new` modifiers
* What are `is`, `.GetType()`, `TypeOf()`, `.IsInstanceOfType()`, and `.IsSubclassOf()` and when to use them



## Notes

I would like to state that the [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/983030/type-checking-typeof-gettype-or-is) that was provided on this project to teach us how to use `TypeOf()`, `.GetType()`, and `is`,
is 12 years old, and about as helpful as a wet paper bag. Seriously Holberton do better, this type of stuff is pathetic.
